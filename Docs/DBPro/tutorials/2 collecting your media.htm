Collecting Your Media<BR>
</FONT></CENTER></FONT></B><BR>
The next step is locating and preparing all your media. Media can be any file that adds into your main program, usually in the form of 3D worlds, 3D models, sounds, music, images and pictures. We will require most of these types of media to create our FPS Game. Though you would resource these media files yourself from Model, Audio and Resource collections, we have prepared the media you will require for this tutorial.<BR>

The media includes a BSP World file for the game level. A sky sphere model for the sky backdrop. A gun model for the player view. An enemy model for the foe we must vanquish. A selection of sounds to bring the game to life including a large looping wave file for our in-game music. A fire image for our particle bullet and a few miscellaneous items to make the game look nicer.<BR>
<BR>
All these media files were sourced from the Dark Basic Professional Resources collection and are all royalty free. It is important that all the media you use is likewise copyrighted to owners who have given express permission before you use their work. The media files once collected are arranged in suitable folders and renamed for easy reference when we focus on our program and away from the names of all our media files.<BR>
