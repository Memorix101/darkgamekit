The first order of business is to create a world in which our game will be set. Once upon a time this was a very difficult proposal and would often become the first major stumbling block for many would be game writers. With the built in BSP commands however, such a task is mind bogglingly simple.<BR>

With a single command we can load an entire BSP world. The BSP file contains information about polygons, collision, textures and even special effects also known as shaders. With a second command we can create a skysphere to provide an enclosed environment for our world:<BR>
<BR>
<PRE><FONT FACE=courier COLOR=BLUE>rem TUT4A
rem Load BSP world and sky model
load bsp "world\ikzdm1.pk3","ikzdm1.bsp"
SkyObj=1 : load object "models\sky\am.x",SkyObj
</FONT></PRE>When the BSP world and sky are loaded, we must setup the camera and ensure the autocam does not start moving around without our direct control. We must also scale down the size of the sky to bring it closer so we bring it within the maximum distance of our 3D universe and switch off sky culling so polygons that would normally show from the outside of the sky sphere will now show on the inside as well:<BR>
<BR>
<PRE><FONT FACE=courier COLOR=BLUE>rem TUT4B
rem Setup camera
set camera range 1,10000
autocam off

rem Setup sky model
set object SkyObj,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
scale object SkyObj,20,20,20
</FONT></PRE>In order that the user stay informed, we will provide a text prompt when the BSP is loading. Sometimes BSP worlds can be very large and can take minutes to fully load, so an onscreen prompt is very important. In order to make our game as presentable as possible, we will choose a nice large font:<BR>
<BR>
<PRE><FONT FACE=courier COLOR=BLUE>rem TUT4C
rem Select font
set text font "arial" : set text size 16
set text to bold : set text transparent

rem Loading prompt
sync : center text screen width()/2,screen height()/2,"LOADING" : sync
</FONT></PRE>The reason for the pre and post additions of the SYNC command is that we have initialised our program with the SYNC ON command. This tells the computer that we would like to update the screen ourselves; manually. In order to see the loading prompt, a sync must be made after we have drawn the text.<BR>
