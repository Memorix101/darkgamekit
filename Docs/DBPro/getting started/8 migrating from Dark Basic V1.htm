For those users who are moving their project over to Dark Basic Professional, or have upgraded and want to get up and running as quickly as possible, the following tips may help your transition.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Command Line Interface<BR>
</FONT><BR>
The CLI is now part of the Debugger and can be located by clicking the Debug Mode Button in the main editor. You will find many of the reasons for having a CLI have been replaced with more powerful Variable Watcher and Program Watcher tools.<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Desktop Full screen<BR>
</FONT><BR>
Be aware that running as DESKTOP and DESKTOPFULL means the application runs in windows mode stretched to the size of the desktop. You still have the option for full screen exclusive mode, as well as hidden mode and standard window mode. Be aware some older cards incur a performance penalty when stretching the contents of a window using the desktop rendering modes.<BR>
<BR>
