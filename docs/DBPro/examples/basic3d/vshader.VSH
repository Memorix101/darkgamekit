// take the vertex position data ( v0 ) and multiply it by the matrix which we have put in 
// register 0, the result is stored in oPos which is the position output register

// multiply the result of the dot product with the diffuse colour and place it in the oD0 
// register

// pass the texture coordinates from the input register ( v7 ) into the output register ( oT0 )
