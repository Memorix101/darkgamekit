<FONT SIZE=3><B>Activating Dark Basic Professional<BR>
</B></FONT><BR>
The latest version of the software uses an online activation system to initially validate your software. This activation is performed onlt once and no further online access will be made by the software after this initial activation. You need access to the internet and an email address, plus you must ensure the firewall is configured to allow both inbound and outbound communication throughout the activation process. A complete guide to the activation process can be found on our website here:<BR>
<BR>
<B>http://darkbasicpro.thegamecreators.com/?f=activation_step_1<BR>
</B><BR>
When your product is not activated, you will see this dialog:<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
And when you click NEXT you will be required to enter your email and the order key you will have been sent on completing the activation process mentioned in the link above:<BR>
<BR>

Once you have activated the software, subsequent runs will quickly display the modules you have installed to the language. You can purchase additional modules at any time by visiting http://darkbasicpro.thegamecreators.com.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=3><B>Upgrading Dark Basic Professional<BR>
</B></FONT><BR>
When an upgrade becomes available, you can simply download and install it freely from our website. Keep checking the forums for news on the latest version, or check out the Support section of the Dark Basic Professional website. The upgrade installer only works when it detects an existing installation of Dark Basic Professional, so if your registry has been altered and your installation path has been lost, you will need to re-install the software from your original DISC or installer file before applying the upgrade. If you un-install without manually clearing the "Dark Basic Professional" folder in "Program Files", and quickly re-install you should not have to re-activate your software as the certificates created by the activation process should still be present on your computer.<BR>
