Dark Game Kit is a cross-platform reimplementation of DarkGDK and DarkBASIC Professional (IDE and compiler) written in C++ using raylib.
It aims to provide native cross-platform support for Windows, Linux, Mac and other platforms.

The goal is to build a cross-platform compiler to compile DB/DBPro code for all target platforms.
